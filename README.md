# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create a database on pgadmin4, set up tables for the downloaded csv file, and finally create columns.

In carrying out this project I aim to do the following

1. Answer questions asked about this data and present this in the best possible way, so that it provides value to the receiver.
   
2. Generate my own questions from the data supplied to show that the data can provide as many possible scenarios that can help a business increase revenue , save costs and focus on the right products
   
3. Cleaning the data, which includes filling columns where the data is null, checking for duplicates in all the tables created.

4. Show the relevance of this data to supply the answers to question to help a business make decisions.

## Process
### (your step 1) 
1. Create database, set up tables, create columns and input with relevant information from the data downloaded

2. Extracting data and uploading the data on PostGreSql into relevant columns

3. Filtering and cleaning data to enable choice of what is useful, relevant to the serve the purpose for which it is needed.

### (your step 2)
1. Use SQL queries to retrieve the data to answer questions that can help the company better under the business, by using one column, one table or several combinations of columns and tables

2. Use SQL queries to retrieve the data to help show trends that affects this business.

3. Use SQL queries to retrieve the data to answer questions that are needed to make important decisions to improve the business of the company.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

1. The data reveals how a business can get information on which places get the most revenue.

2. The  data can show the business which product sells the most and what location buys certain products the most.

3. The data can show which site are visited and how long a user makes a choice one a selection

4. The data can show how long it takes a product to be restocked.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

1. Figuring the required information that is needed to get the specific results needed. E.g Some of the city cells were empty and thus
getting a specific decision pending to each city was difficult.

2. Some of the columns had empty cells which made filtering difficult, generating revenue that was supplied but with more empty cells than
filled cells.


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

1. Clean up the presentation of many of the columns, so that they are more presentable to the recipient of the information.
   
2. Arrange the data so that the empty columns will be filled with information that will better explain the situation of each column 
 
3. Calculate some of the columns that had revenue and fill them with the needed information
