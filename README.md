Extracting data and uploading the data on PostGreSql into relevant columns
Filtering and cleaning data to enable choice of what is useful, relevant to the serve the purpose for which it is needed.

The data can show which site are visited and how long a user makes a choice one a selection

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

Figuring the required information that is needed to get the specific results needed.
Some of the columns had empty cells which made filtering difficult


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

1. Clean up the presentation of many of the columns, so that they are more presentable to the reader.
2. Arrange the data so that the empty columns will filled with information that will better explain the situation of that particular column instead it being null
3. Calculate some of the columns that had revenue and fill them with the needed information
